  Name: Charlie
  Motivation: 

  Let's test our first commit.
  My motivation for attending this class is to learn and master ruby and ruby on rails myself. The goal is always self improvement. If I can teach someone else, I can teach myself.

  I want to bring out the best in each other and highlight each other's qualitites.

  My professional goals are to createflexibility for myself in my work so I can start a family and find work life balance. I alsohope to be a team lead soon for our client and help others carry out their goals and to open up a door for possibilities to others.

  My goal here is to motivate myself and the motivate my classmates, to make them feels like this career shift is possible for you. Through hard work and dedications, it is possible.
